BEYBLADE I wanted to be a hero But I think I've been searching in all the
wrong places.A brightened room to
<P>
a darkened shadow. Bring forth a challenge with lives on the line. Will my
spirit rise? Will my spirit fall?
<P>
I try to win, but I hear defeat calling. Am I trying too hard? Is it impossible?
Will I live in this
<P>
eternal darkness befalling? Only time will hold my victory.I look to find
the hero in me...
